Good article,
  http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt612/slyt612.pdf

  Typical gate - is a p and n channel - with inverted gate drive. so that they balance.

DG1411 is really very good - even if tssop
  On-resistance: 1.5 
  On-resistance flatness: 0.3 
  250mA
  2nA typical leakage.


1,10,100,1k -  relayor two mosfets...
10k,100k,1M, - dg1411
more         - max626

So - don't use analog switches - just use simple mosfets.
    issue of leakage. 

--------
flatness

TS12A44513
  1ohm flatness. 0-12V, leakage 10nA  

rON(flat)

1ohm  - if we use it will need to be relay.
10ohm - 

-------
JFETs typically allow current in both directions so two aren’t needed for
bidirectional operation like with MOSFE

j111 is 30ohm with 0V VGS,
  leakage is 1nA when G is -10V

j108 is 8ohm with 0V, leakage is 10nA with -10V 



-------
10k is 1mA  - ie 10V range for 1mA.   I think 100nA leakage is not very good.
    just use dg444 which adds 50ohm. 
    but flatness is 10ohm over range.  1 in 1000 non-linearity.

    jfet might be better.

If we are potentially going to have 10V across the current-sense - then we loose that
as headroom.

The problem is not the conductivity of the switch inside the relay but the
leckage currents because of the isolation material!  Switching nA or pA with
relays should be avoided.

lm317 - adjustable.  1976

  The LM318 is an adjustable analogue to the popular 78xx fixed regulators. 


7805 versus - op-amp (741) and power transistor?
  I have a precision reference.

  Or even just a zener on the base of a

Get 5V coil version for best availability - and use 7805 or similar to power.

G6S-2F  2F is the gull wing.
  
  - G6S-2F - minimum permissible load,  10μA, 10 mVDC
  THIS IS OK - FOR THE HIGHER VALUES.
  - for low values - we can never turn off. but just use max326

  - this is the same, as 238 design - which always has high-value resistors in circuit.n 

  - hmmmm - need gold plated contacts for nA.

VERY IMPORTANT
  - but if resistor is before switch - then it adds additional resistance. 

  - max326 - 1pA leakage typical. but 1.2k on resistance 

  - dg444  50ohm, 80pA
      100pA at 10V is 1Gohm

  - dg408  - 0.5 nA leakage
      100ohm,   eg. dg444 is better in all ways.

  - dg1411 - 1ohm,  +-2 nA leakage, 90mA continuous.  
      1k, 10k, 100k  = 10mA, 1mA, 100uA
      2nA with 10V is 500M, or 5Gohm

  - 100, 10 ohm, and 1 ohm  - can just use 2x n-channel transistors.
                              or even 3 relays

  - irb540 g/s is 100nA, eg 0.1uA which is fine.. but zero gate voltage drain current is 25uA.
    2n7000 is 1uA drain current.



use relays + switches.
  eg. 1k switch and 10k resistor?
  10k switch and 100k resistor

  - issue of heat.


VERY IMPORTANT - why not measure the load across the resistor
    and ignore the switch. 
    - it's more complicated to do differential ended. hmmm. 
    - the issue is that in parallel - current will go across other switches.
      so in fact it's not very useful.
    - so it basically has to be trimmed out.

For a bi-directional power switch put two MOSFET's in series, typically two
P-ch's so you pull down on gates to turn both devices on. This is the way it is
commonly done in cellphones where USB-OTG can source current or run
phone/charge battery. You could use N-ch's but you would have to push the gate
voltage above the switched supplies which is usually not an option.

So bottom line, the FET will conduct in both directions, but it will turn off
in only one direction. So be careful. If you need it to turn on and off in both
directions, then you need to place two MOSFETs back-to-back (there are nuances
to be careful of, too).c0

V = I / R

1 amp across 0.1ohm = 10V - would be a nice range.  but would need a relay - or amplify?.
1 amp across 1ohm = 1V 

100ma  across 1ohm = 100mV  

100ma across 10 ohm = 10V ? 

1mA across   1k = 1mV

are we using amplification? i don't think so.

- underscores - in names eg V-SET should be V_SET to be consistent
- pinout for to-220 transistors. (understand how they're assigned)
- just need the feedback dividers and multiplexors. 
- the ability to short the slew control

- ignore the floating output and high-voltage output gain stage.
- 12MHz crystal for fpga.
- on-board 3.3V regulators?

TODO
  - definitely add teh comparison op-amp after the clamps - because
    it needs the precision gnd value.
   - it might also make sensei to use the dac for filter and slew control
   - and multiplx the fb into the adc
   - 

  - add divider to knock down the DAC range to 5V - to give us 10V range. 

TODO
  - change 0V to AGND and DGND, REFGND etc. and HEATGND,  etc.
  - decoupling.
  - pricing of larger boards...

  - do the 144 pin fpga?

TODO

- pull the inverted reference out to pin headers - to be able to use

- mounting holes in corners.
- fix diodes
- tidy silk-screen positioning

op-37 suggests output current less than 10mA

"high gain and excellent linearity can be achieved by operating the op amp with
a peak output current of less than ± 10 mA"

driver to npn common-emitter  at 5 volt. 5 / 1k is max of 5mA 


fzt658
  - 400V
  - hfe 50 at 100mA
  - continuous current 0.5A  

----
5mA op-amp output, * 50. 5 to 1 voltage ratio  3 

transformer is 25V AC, assume 36 volts DC loaded peak, assume 38 V 

need to use minimum, assume 25 Volts, 10 volts mosfet, therefore need 2 to 1 ratio 

2k to 1k 
30V / 1k is 30mA,  
1k to 500... 2 / 1 approx volts

maybe use 3 to 1 so can use near 15 volts...
assume op-amp at 4 volt output, then 4 * 3 = 12 volt swing. so 1 to 3. ratio. 

- op-amp
  - 5mA op-amp output,  
  - 5 volt swing, then use 1k output resistor to give 5mA

- common-emitter
  if 15V rail,
    - 3 to 1 ratio. eg. 1k to 300 ohm.
    - 5 volts will be max V swing away from rail. 
    - 15V / 1k top will 15mA output 

  - we don't want much current, because want zener to shunt excess voltage if exceeds value. 
  - 15V * 15mA = 0.2W
  - 30V * 30mA = 0.9W  (bit too high). maybe ok, because won't need to shunt all the voltage  

- simple emitter-follower
  if 15V rail
    - 15mA * 50hfe = 750mA   
  if 30V rail. 500mA continuous rating
    don't think this is right. instead the degradation will be the minimum current. eg. 1k - the sink speed... 
    R1 in emitter is chosen based on quintesent current. eg. lowest value when no signal applied.

  - i think we need push-pull because mosfet has to be able to sink.
  - but then we need biasing - so we at least need diodes. 
  - but why not use diamond pattern

  - push/pull
    R = V / I = 30V / 500mA = 60 ohm gate resistor.

if use straight emitter follower, then how to calculate the degradation resistor?
