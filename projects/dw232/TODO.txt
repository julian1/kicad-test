- another alternative - run two or three of them at slightly different TC0 offsets. to flatten the 
  peak. issue is still self heating.

- compensate non-linearity with a micro. 
- 



Important - can test resistor temp stability - by just spraying with isopropyl. 
- increase the small op-amp resistor?

-------
6.263,800

----
CRITICAL THE ZENER needs to be buffered.
  - if this was the problem - it may be possible to use adjustment pots.

the zener sense is coming after the 200. so feeding off that to get out temp-set voltage isn't great. 

  - it should be pretty easy - to just use out instead - and divide it down - with a pot. as as test.
  - we know the actual temp-set voltage as well.

  - we just need a 10k on top. as well.

-----
ok 5.495 is about 48C . but why is there a curve back???? 385 ohms...

  - is it the ciruit - we should be using a divider - using out. rather than the zener   

----
OK - I think there's a real problem.gg

-------
run 36
5k + 2.5k + 1k / 10k.

peak is 5.55 = 52C


-------------------------------------
run35

5k + 2.5k / 10k. = out 1.094
apex is at 5.490. case temp about 40C. so need another 10C = 1mA 
  so need about 1.104 out V or a bit more.
  1k is 11.24gg


-------------------------------------
run34 after adjusting to 10.6V

(10.6 - 6.236) / 200 = 0.02182 = 21.8mA
  it looks like - need another 15C = 2mA

If we can calculate the damn output voltage we just need to try a few resistors.

need 10.9-11V

-------------------------------------
run33

looks like a peak around 5.440, ambient. 22C

  - current current = (9.97 - 6.236) / 200 = 18.6mA  
  -
  - for 50C operating temp - need 50 - 22 = +30C / 7.5  = 4 more mA
  - so need 23mA

   (0.023 * 200) + 6.236
    10.836 out voltage

  - we only have 10.6V range - lets try that




full right out 10.596, ref 6.246
full left  out 9.97  , ref 6.235 

-----
So try 
  1. use prec resistors - and plot
  2. use prec trimpots - and plot
  3. replace trimpots with resistors
  

-----
If we had a DAC - we could dial in the set current - on the inverter. we have 100/1 range. 
  - can do this by paralleizing the dac output - with the prec-resistors.  
  - the or even a digital pot - in parallel?.

once we have the needed values - then we sould be able to just lock int the values.

----
run-32

done - hook it up - heater off - and characterize it.
  run-30
  - heater turned off.
  - ambient (start) is t-sense of 5.446   eg. 22C
  - apex is at t-sense 5.456              eg. 30C

calculate required apex for running temp - eg. 50C
  - need to move TC0 point up 20C.  
  - TC0 moves 10C/mA,  so need 2mA more current - actually 7.5C/mA 
  - V out is 10.10V. (10.10 - 6.25) / 200 = 19.2mA 
  - if Vout is set to 10.55 that should give 20.25mA

run again - with heater on
  TC0 apex now at t-sense 5.485, which looks to be about 43C, which is ok, which might be delayed. 

  - so lets just set t-set to 5.485

adjust current for TC, test, using heater on - to heat as well.



dial in the set temp.

issue is we have to have the heater - on to do the tests - that's ok just wire it on - and plot.

Good.

  5.1k / 10k
  full-right -       out = 10.045V,    3.791V                             17.5mA
  full left -        out = 9.120V,    2.887V across 200ohm resistor, eg. 14mA. 

  5.1k + 500 / 10k
    ref = 6.258      out = 10.372  max.  = 4.114 = 20.5mA   - starts rising.
    ref = 6.241      out = 9.420V min    = 3.179 = 15.5mA   - immediately starts falling.
        May not be quite right - because didn't have enough voltage.

  5.1k + 1k / 10k.
          6.264      out = 10.686   max  - rises - eg abou    - 23mA
          6.246      out =  9.70   min  - holds about steady  - 18mA

          this is a bit strange. looks like the max is set...
  
          CAREFUL - needs more than 12V. about 12

-----
temp-set,   
  full left is 5.213V

current-set, 

Should test minimum and max range. actually can calculate it.

TODO
  - ferrite bead on inputs.
  - ok - we *must* use out. and not zener ref. for the voltage control.
  - should keep the heat generating 200ohm over near the hot 2dw232
  - invert and current resistor for peltier driver?
  - manually change the routes going to the 

Right - issue - is that we can't connect probes have 

VERY IMPORTANT - maybe pull out temp sense. and 

The sense is wrong. should be pulled out before the 10k. But it should still work - we just
  can easily know the temp-sense voltage.

there is an additional issue - that some current 1mA is being sunk through the sense. 
  but it should be more stable.

think can get rid of the dicky resistors.

inverter so that we can peltier? 

---- hmmm - maybe it isn't wrong - since it's the value on the input op-amp 
  no it's the loop charge variable. not the temp sense. 


----
For peltier - wait until have boards - then just add an inverter - and current
  sense resistor.

parallel divider might be better.
  eg. if have 1k trim range. then can just add a 10k in parallel with it.
  actually it will severely change taper
  better with 2k + 2k pot

--------
PCB

- move the short resistors in under the trimpots. 

- Use ptf56 for the dividers. and use z201 100 or similar for the current.

- guard traces around op-amp inputs

- edge mounting holes - based on vias

- move the pcb edges in from the out (outline/mechanical)? 

----

- no - a ring guard around the entire circuit. emi really important 
  - actually not sure will do anything - already have gnd around entire circuit

- done - set the current resistor back a bit more from the reference.
    we moved it to the other side

- done - support for trimmers.

- done - perhaps center the resistors more vertically on board outline, not bottom 

- done - more space for the text - eg. HGND is not readable 

- done - more space between traces 0.25 to 0.5.

- done - need to decide whether to use z-out or v-out for the temperature set 
    - the issue is that v-out is not stable and will change whenever current is adjusted.
    - while z-sense will be more stable - but it is an additional load.

    - it's a 100ohm source - so it's a low-impedance source. so should be
      ok.
    - this is the same as veroboard

- done - the cap on the -ve input with resistors - is an RC circuit - which is good.

- done - z-sense, z-sense-gnd, and another jumper?

- done - check edwin's recommended trimpot  3250

- done - 5 resistors. or a trimpot in center?
    - and with a jumper to decide

- done - probably should have possibility of five resistors 

- no - button - or pin jumper to turn heater on/off 
  - eg. short the heater control op-amp input to high. Useful for testing.  could just short the resistor divider.
  - need to analyze circuit.
  - could do it with two pin headers - no that's what trimpot does.

- done - pull out the temp sense, and tempt set. to local test-pads even if don't pull them all the way. can then solder a pin hook.

- done - pull out the temperature value eg. 5.6 as a pin - can't believe didn't do this

- done - get rid of the -ve rail, or 0R to jump

- done - ferrite bead.  smt.

- no - optional larger dampening capacitor for op-amp input - eg. 2.2uF to gnd 
  on the + input.
    - not needed - can just substitute

- no - pull out the dammn divider as well. so can check for resistor hystersis 
    - just need op-amp output V-OUT. resistor divider will be same as ref - apart
      from op-amp input offset.


- no - need larger resistor - pads for ptf56

- no - cooling pad for both the transistor collectors
    they don't get very hot
  
- done - a 0R resistor to connect AGND and -VE
  - or an extra pin header - to connect them with a jumper

----

- done - markings for pin headers.
- done - tidy position 
- done - copyright

- there's a problem that the solder mask has no 

Since I am using dividers - chasing a low TCR is not that critical - only constant tracking TCR. 

If I hand-wound a divider on the same support/substrate material to minimize differential self-heating due to the different voltage-drops, then good TCR tracking should be achievable. 

Also, hand-wiring ought to make it easier to dial in zener TC0 current - by simply adjusting the number turns. And without needing a big box of fixed-resistor parts on hand to mix and match the right values.

issue with evanohm is that it needs to be welded to create solderable connections.



Except that Vishay prec are very very accurate resistances 0.01% etc. which if it was a meter of wire - would be 0.1mm difference.

  its 800 because it's 800ohms Î© CMF

If both resistors are dissipating the same power levels, then the self-heating
will be the same and the TCR will track as expected, all else being equal.  If
the power levels are different, then the self-heating is going to cause an
apparent TCR mis-tracking which will be blamed on the resistors.  Surprisingly,
I've seen this mistake made by engineers pretty often.

So in the case of the 12.5K / 1K divider, there is roughly a 15:1 power ratio,
if this is not taken into consideration when selecting the resistors....it
isn't going to work like the man (or lady) said it would.

---

I disagree in one aspect: The Vishay hermetically sealed, oil filled resistors
really are longterm stable, as Vishay claims, i.e << 1ppm/year.  My 4 year long
monitoring of agroup of 5 VHP resistors show a drift of less than 1 ppm.

In contrast to that, I did not find (yet) wirewound resistors, which are
promoted to have a similar good long term stability.

absolute TCR not important - tracking TCR is. so long as divider is made from same compound
  should be good.

- a softer compound - thermal sikaflex, rather than thermal expoxy might be better.

- what about peliter mounted flat on pcb - with via stiching for heat transfer.
    - then several - eg. 3 heaters and coolers on the pcb - placed around the components?.
    - use via stiching up to the pads
    - two resistors/peltiers on loops. no summing or anything. 
    - put resistors in vertical alignment to minimize gradient. 

- peltier and nomca? 

- hmmmm - a prec wire-wound divider - on the same device. should be much better for TCR - than
    two indpendent resistors.

  The TCR of CarTech EVANOHM alloy R can be supplied at Â±5 parts per million per
  Â°C from - 65 to + 125Â°C in fine sizes.

nomca are 25ppm. not that great. 5ppm tracking.

with ptf56 being cheap - we could buy a bunch and match them.
  - only if balanced around 25 


- for longer term drift 
  - perhaps 3x refs. 1x expensive z201, 2x inexpensive ptf56


VERY IMPORANT
  - if need two layers for traces.
  - then perhaps better to have traces wrapping gnd.
  - layers .
    - trace
    - gnd
    - trace and -ve
    - +ve
  
    - this gets the traces on each side of the gnd plane, .
      - although it's harder to understand if they're 
      not visiablbe

Yes. I think it's correct. The usual advice is that signals
should be sandwitched. routing them on the bottom plane, means it's referenced to +ve.

But,
 A signal running over a reference plane, whose voltage happens
to be at VCC will still return over that reference plane. So the
argument that somehow having your signal run over GND and not
VCC is better is basically invalid.

the standard stack-up is
    Signals
    GND
    VCC
    Singals
