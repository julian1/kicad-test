PCB

- Use ptf56 for the dividers. and use z201 100 or similar for the current.

- ferrite bead.  smt.

- set the current resistor back a bit more from the reference.

- optional larger dampening capacitor - eg. 2.2uF to gnd on the + input.

- pull out the dammn divider as well. so can check for resistor hystersis 
- maybe need larger resistor - pads for ptf56

- pull out the temperature value eg. 5.6 as a pin - can't believe didn't do this

- a ring guard around the entire circuit. really important 

- more space between traces 0.25 to 0.5.
- guard traces around op-amp inputs
- edge mounting holes - based on vias
- perhaps center the resistors vertically on board outline, they sit at bottom 

- more space for the text - eg. HGND is not readable 
- cooling pad for both the transistor collectors

- a 0R resistor to connect AGND and -VE
  - or an extra pin header - to connect them with a jumper
  - no use a resistor.

now 99x25

without top，bottom solder mask 
without keepout layer 

， - think should be OK. ver

maybe because there were no zones.

- done - markings for pin headers.
- done - tidy position 
- done - copyright

- there's a problem that the solder mask has no 
  h


Does anyone have a source for insulated evanohm wire? 

Since I am using dividers - chasing a low TCR is not that critical - only constant tracking TCR. 

If I hand-wound a divider on the same support/substrate material to minimize differential self-heating due to the different voltage-drops, then good TCR tracking should be achievable. 

Also, hand-wiring ought to make it easier to dial in zener TC0 current - by simply adjusting the number turns. And without needing a big box of fixed-resistor parts on hand to mix and match the right values.

issue is that it needs to be welded.



Except that Vishay prec are very very accurate resistances 0.01% etc. which if it was a meter of wire - would be 0.1mm difference.

  for other names,

  its 800 because it's 800ohms Ω CMF

If both resistors are dissipating the same power levels, then the self-heating
will be the same and the TCR will track as expected, all else being equal.  If
the power levels are different, then the self-heating is going to cause an
apparent TCR mis-tracking which will be blamed on the resistors.  Surprisingly,
I've seen this mistake made by engineers pretty often.

So in the case of the 12.5K / 1K divider, there is roughly a 15:1 power ratio,
if this is not taken into consideration when selecting the resistors....it
isn't going to work like the man (or lady) said it would.

I disagree in one aspect: The Vishay hermetically sealed, oil filled resistors
really are longterm stable, as Vishay claims, i.e << 1ppm/year.  My 4 year long
monitoring of agroup of 5 VHP resistors show a drift of less than 1 ppm.

In contrast to that, I did not find (yet) wirewound resistors, which are
promoted to have a similar good long term stability.

absolute TCR not important - tracking TCR is. so long as divider is made from same compound
  should be good.

- a softer compound - thermal sikaflex, rather than thermal expoxy might be better.

- what about peliter mounted flat on pcb - with via stiching for heat transfer.
    - then several - eg. 3 heaters and coolers on the pcb - placed around the components?.
    - use via stiching up to the pads
    - two resistors/peltiers on loops. no summing or anything. 
    - put resistors in vertical alignment to minimize gradient. 

- peltier and nomca? 

- hmmmm - a prec wire-wound divider - on the same device. should be much better for TCR - than
    two indpendent resistors.

  The TCR of CarTech EVANOHM alloy R can be supplied at ±5 parts per million per
  °C from - 65 to + 125°C in fine sizes.

nomca are 25ppm. not that great. 5ppm tracking.

with ptf56 being cheap - we could buy a bunch and match them.
  - only if balanced around 25 


- for longer term drift 
  - perhaps 3x refs. 1x expensive z201, 2x inexpensive ptf56


VERY IMPORANT
  - if need two layers for traces.
  - then perhaps better to have traces wrapping gnd.
  - layers .
    - trace
    - gnd
    - trace and -ve
    - +ve
  
    - this gets the traces on each side of the gnd plane, .
      - although it's harder to understand if they're 
      not visiablbe

Yes. I think it's correct. The usual advice is that signals
should be sandwitched. routing them on the bottom plane, means it's referenced to +ve.

But,
 A signal running over a reference plane, whose voltage happens
to be at VCC will still return over that reference plane. So the
argument that somehow having your signal run over GND and not
VCC is better is basically invalid.

------
I'm designing a 4 layer PCB and I know that the standard stack-up is
    Signals
    GND
    VCC
    Singals

This implies that signals route with regard to VCC - and thats ok.

Thinner board - maybe better.
