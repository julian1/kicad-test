- pull out the temperature value eg. 5.6 as a pin - can't believe didn't do this

- more space between traces 0.25 to 0.5.
- guard traces around op-amp inputs
- edge mounting holes - based on vias
- center the resistors vertically on board outline 
- more space for the text - eg. HGND is not readable 
- cooling pad for both the transistor collectors

- a 0R resistor to connect AGND and -VE
  - or an extra pin header - to connect them with a jumper

now 99x25

without top，bottom solder mask 
without keepout layer 

， - think should be OK. ver

maybe because there were no zones.

- done - markings for pin headers.
- done - tidy position 
- done - copyright

- there's a problem that the solder mask has no 
  h


VERY IMPORANT
  - if need two layers for traces.
  - then perhaps better to have traces wrapping gnd.
  - layers .
    - trace
    - gnd
    - trace and -ve
    - +ve
  
    - this gets the traces on each side of the gnd plane, .
      - although it's harder to understand if they're 
      not visiablbe

Yes. I think it's correct. The usual advice is that signals
should be sandwitched. routing them on the bottom plane, means it's referenced to +ve.

But,
 A signal running over a reference plane, whose voltage happens
to be at VCC will still return over that reference plane. So the
argument that somehow having your signal run over GND and not
VCC is better is basically invalid.

------
I'm designing a 4 layer PCB and I know that the standard stack-up is
    Signals
    GND
    VCC
    Singals

This implies that signals route with regard to VCC - and thats ok.

Thinner board - maybe better.
